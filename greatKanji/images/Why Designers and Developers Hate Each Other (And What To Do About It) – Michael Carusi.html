<p dir="ltr">“That designer is such an idiot. How am I supposed to know he wanted the text to fade when you hover over it?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Why do they hire moronic developers like this? Wouldn’t it be easy to modify the navigation bar?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Take a walk down through virtually any creative agency or web development company. You even see it when a web designer and web developer are collaborating on a contracting project. Designers and developers are in a perennial state of war, and have been since the inception of the Internet.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So what can we do to call a truce? This is a lengthy post, so grab a coffee and take a seat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Definitions</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">First of all, let’s define a designer and a developer, since the terms are often erroneously used interchangeably.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A <strong>designer</strong> is an individual who works with graphics and artistry. They create logos, color schemes, user interfaces, website skins and aesthetic designs in Photoshop, Gimp, and Illustrator. Sometimes they’ll use programs like Dreamweaver to bring the design to life, but often their role is strictly design if they’re working with a developer. This is especially true at agencies and web companies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A <strong>developer</strong> writes code from the ground up. They create markup, style the website or application, use scripting and programming languages, create infrastructure, do debugging, and depending on the project, they install CMSes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As stereotypical as it sounds, designers are creative types and developers are logical types, and opposite personalities tend to give rise to conflict. Feuds tend to be less of an issue with experienced team members. Veteran web designers usually “get it” because they’ve learned HTML, CSS, and possibly even some JavaScript. You run into trouble when a print or purely-graphcs based designer starts working with an experienced developer. The same problems arise when a developer hasn’t worked with external designers before.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now let’s look at the expectations of both parties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Designer Expectations</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><p dir="ltr">The designer wants to watch an artistic project slowly take shape throughout revisions. Designers want to let creativity flow. Imagination takes priority it’s not uncommon for designers to scrap and redo entire projects multiple times, especially for something as detailed as an application UI or a website PSD.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Things tend to go bad when the designer, sometimes unaware of how much work is involved with development, constantly requests changes during development processes, or repeatedly backtracks or revises requests for changes. Even worse is when a designer takes a screenshot of a developer’s half-finished product and starts revising it in Photoshop (it happens). The developer starts to feel like the designer is using him or her without understanding the develoer’s work.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Developer Expectations</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The developer’s expectations tend to be simpler: Take the information and build the product based on the information given. Make sure everything is running cleanly and that there are no bugs, and present the finished software or product.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Things go south when the information provided by the designer is incomplete, which it almost always will be. The designer will be irked that the developer didn’t match the designer’s vision, interpreting it as having to do extra work, and due to poor communication a dozen revisions will ensue. The designer also feels like the logical side of web development is interfering with the creative process.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>So who’s right?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Both parties are right on different levels. There just needs to be some understanding, empathizing, and communication between the creative type and the logical type to ensure good relations and to in turn make the project more rewarding and less miserable.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Having been in the position of both web designer and web developer, I’ve pinpointed some key points that designers and developers should consider so the relationship is one of mutual respect rather than fantasies involving beatings with car batteries.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>For the Designers</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>1. Realize that the Developer Doesn’t Know Your Vision</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Don’t think that the developer you’re working with will assume anything about your design. I know it’s your design and you have a vision for it, but that’s the problem: The developer doesn’t know the vision. You need to articulate it in excruciating detail. Developers can’t assume anything; imagine a contractor building an extra wing for a house under the assumption that the homeowner wanted it, only to discover the homeowner didn’t want it, or wanted it done a different way. Developers feel that way after discovering they wrote a lot of CSS and JavaScript for nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>2. Don’t Make Revision Requests As the Site Is Being Developed</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Designers are used to making lots of revisions over time, but nothing will annoy a developer faster than this. Take enough time to truly nail down the true, final version of the PSD you need developed, and then back away and let the developers bring it to life. To go back to the house analogy, making revisions mid-development asks developers to deconstruct chunks of a house and rebuild it in a different way depending on how the site is being built. It makes developers resentful, which designers interpret as an attitude problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>3. Get Granular With Measurements and Technical Points</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">This gets more mathematical from the earlier point. Don’t give the developer a PSD and expect them to figure out spacing, colors, or measurements; this is lays the framework for the development not coming out the way the designer wanted it to and necessitating 15 revisions that slow the process down. Specify pixels, dimensions, fonts and color hex codes. Numbers are your best friend when it comes to communicating your specific needs to get the look and feel that you want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>4. Learn, Learn, Learn!</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">As a designer, you aren’t going to be expected to be fluent in server side scripting or C++, but you should at least be familiar with CSS, the language of web styling. Your developer will really appreciate it, and to be honest, we’re at a point where almost everybody – marketer, designer, project manager – needs to know baseline markup and styling fundamentals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>For the Developers</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>1. Clearly Articulate Your Needs</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Sadly, not every web designer is going to drop off a detailed PDF with the finalized design and a completely itemized list of fonts, stylings, and requirements. This is something designers should keep in mind, but you can do your part to make sure you have everything you need. Ask every question you need about the design in excruciating detail: What’s the font being used? What are the hex color codes? Is this what you meant with this note? What did you mean by that note? It’s a discovery process that sounds tedious, but will save you a lot of feuding down the road.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>2. Contribute to the Designer’s Vision</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Go above and beyond just developing what the designer provides you. Sit down over cups of coffee and really pick the designer’s brain over what encouraged them to go this route with the design. Offer some constructive feedback and suggestions on how to improve the site. It will help you get a sense of how designers tick, and they’ll be grateful for the input and collaboration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>3. Be a Teacher, Not a Preacher</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Some designers understand the technical side of website work, but for others JavaScript may as well be the elven language in Lord of the Rings. You’ll wind up doing some educating in terms of development requirements and your needs. When the designer doesn’t know what CSS is, don’t act like the designer is clueless and doesn’t deserve to be in the profession. It only breeds resentment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>4. Don’t Speak Too Much Like a Developer</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I know you don’t perceive discussions about PHP or JavaScript as technobabble, but your designer probably does. It irks the designer when you speak a language they don’t understand when it comes</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus: For Project Managers and Business Owners</strong></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">This one’s for the unfortunate middlemen – consultants, business owners, project managers – who get caught in the crossfire. Here’s how to ease tensions when your only fault pairing up two incompatible team members.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>1. Notice The Signs</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">You’re a team manager, but think of yourself as a cheerleader. During meetings, watch the way your developer and designer communicate. Do they have a good rapport? Is either party looking annoyed, resentful, or struggling not to tell the other off? Does it seem like the developer is fantasizing about swinging a tire iron?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>2. Encourage Friendships</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">There’s no reason that everything has to stay strictly professional. During breaks, sit your team members down over coffee, or even offer to foot the bill for lunch. Talk with them about the latest industry trends or personal anecdotes. If time permits, take them out during happy hour, or even play a game online with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>3. Stay In Touch</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Encourage some dialogue between team members even if it’s not work related. Depending on the size and scope project, designers and developers can go weeks without speaking to one another, which is no good if there are problems. Find an excuse to E-mail both of them, however minor, even if it’s a lolcats picture or a video of a celebrity tripping up a flight of stairs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>4. If All Else Fails, Address It</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">If nothing else is working, stage an intervention. Bring your designer and developer to the table (or via videoconference if you’re working remotely) and tackle the problem head on: “Look, I’ve been noticing some issues lately I wanted to address…” Don’t accuse either party of instigating conflict and focus on coming to an accord.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Why This Matters</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Good relationships matter because the relationship quality between team members – be it a mom and pop store freelancing project or a huge in-house Fortune 1000 project – is always reflected in the final presentation to the client. A good relationship is just as likely to produce stellar work as a bad relationship is to make a client cringe. That’s going to affect your bottom line – especially when clients are more likely to return to designers and developers they trust for repeat business.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also consider how long you’ll be working with each other. If you’re putting in 14 hour days at an advertising agency and sharing a project with a designer you hate, a single week is going to be unbearable.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So step out of your comfort zone and go out of your way to learn how</p>

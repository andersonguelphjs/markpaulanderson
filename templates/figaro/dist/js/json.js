      "content":"When i was growing up in Canada, Maclean’s and Chatelaine magazines seemed to be in every house. On coffee tables, wicker baskets, neatly stacked beside fireplaces. <strong>Never saw anyone ever reading them, mind you, but they were there.</strong> As a kid, I had no inking of politics of course. They were just magazines, part of the domestic landscape, surreptitiously placed in my world without comment. I’m not sure I would have even identified then as women’s magazines. <strong>I suppose the definition of normal is what is so orthodox to you, it prompts no further questioning. </strong><br><br>I would not say the same today, naturally. <strong>Today, I am wizened/jaded enough to know that every point of view is informed, every product a window into the desires of its creator, an aiming, a fulfillment of needs of various kinds for various actors. </strong><br><br>As such, there is virtually no reason I would ever read Maclean’s or Chatelaine, and, until last week I hadn’t read an article from these publications in literal decades. <strong>That is, until I read these two pieces that decided to attack Jordan Peterson (JP), whom I follow on Twitter, and of whom—full disclosure, I am a big fan of, although I am not uncritical of him. </strong>One of the articles was written well, the other poorly, but what struck me were that both were such abject failures in argumentation, I was honestly shocked. Of course, the case is easily made that 'argument’ is not at all the aim of these pieces.<br><br><a href='http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/is-jordan-peterson-the-stupid-mans-smart-person/'>Is Jordan Peterson the stupid man’s smart person?</a><br><br><a target='_blank' href='http://www.chatelaine.com/opinion/jordan-peterson-gender/'>University of Toronto Prof Jordan Peterson’s Dangerous Views On Why Men Assault Women</a><br><br>Chatelaine quotes one of Peterson’s tweets:<br><br><blockquote class='twitter-tweet' data-lang='en'><p lang='en' dir='ltr'>With all the accusations of sex assault emerging (eg Louis CK) we are going to soon remember why sex was traditionally enshrined in marriage...</p>&mdash; Jordan B Peterson (@jordanbpeterson) <a target='_blank' href='https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson/status/928981541849522176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw'>November 10, 2017</a></blockquote><script async src='https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js' charset='utf-8'></script><br><br>And then swiftly rebuts it as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Wait, let’s get this straight: The decline of traditional marriage is what led Roy Moore to paw at teenagers, and drove Louis C.K. to pull his penis out in the company of female comics? Like many of Peterson’s notions, it’s presented as pseudo-profound but soon wilts under scrutiny. So let’s scrutinize: First, it’s not sex itself that’s the problem, but sex without consent. Second, marital rape exists. And finally, let’s not forget: many of the powerful, famous men who currently stand accused of sexual assault happen to be married.”</blockquote><br><br>So let us ourselves 'scrutinize’ a few points of this 'intellectual' takedown.<br><br>The author assumes that what Peterson is saying is that the actions of Roy Moore, Louis CK and other happened because of the decline of the traditional marriage, implying that according to JP, the mere fact of being married should have prevented rape and sexual assault. <strong>But that is incorrect, you see, because some of these men <i>were</i> married and oh by the way, even married men have been known to rape their spouses! And that’s that. The arguments of a psychiatrist with 100 peer reviewed papers under his belt, who has occupied crème de la crème positions at Harvard and the University of Toronto, have 'wilted’ under the most basic 'scrutiny’. </strong><br><br>Oh, this is just too easy--and that is the problem. Simply laughable if it were not so <i>SAD!</i> on a Trumpian order. These remarks just cannot be taken seriously as 'scrutiny’ and certainly not an 'argument’. <strong>Clearly they would only be gleefully swallowed by someone snugly in the choir she’s preaching to—and those someones too are also not interested in dissecting an argument, but are interested in I don’t know, being on a side, part of a tribal team, a group-thinking team (who undoubtedly believe in TEAMWORK) as righteous as they are odious, a team with grievances to air for whom someone (the other team!) must pay. </strong><br><br>What Peterson is saying of course is that the sexual impulse is primal, strong, definitely potentially dangerous to others, eminently selfish and domineering, savage even, an enemy of reason and law, and, since time immemorial an antithetical source of social peace and harmony. <strong>Therefore <i>perhaps</i> the institution of marriage arose to contain it, to civilize and sublimate it morally and legally. </strong>It does not say that marriage alone would vanquish nature simply by virtue of its legal enshrinement. Obviously. Anyone with any hint of actually wanting to understand JP’s ideas would pick this up.<br><br>Of course, these mags are mailing in the argumentation because they are not interested in them intellectually. Those ideas do not mesh with the ideology of their constituency—the left, liberals, the progressives, the women, the minorities and don’t forget the beta males.  <strong>Did I miss anyone?</strong> The baddies? Why, the conservatives and libertarians, the alt-right, toxic masculinity, whiteness, stupidity, ignorance, violence and if I were to find one umbrella for all of these neanderthals, it is the umbrella of Hate.  Does fighting this long historical battle appeal to you? <strong>Then, read along, buy our product, you are sure to be soothed. We tap into your deepest fear, we attack willy-nilly. Cackle between the lines at your leisure.</strong> <br><br>What is utterly lost here is that the way to most convincingly win a debate is to put forth your opponents best possible argument and then systematically dismantle it. The least convincing way is to avoid the parts you think you can’t win.  Nowhere do these articles raise Peterson’s actual thought, his  very popularly held concerns about an overly politically correct society, about the rising extremism of the left, the suffocating suppressive worldview that has infected every sphere of public and government life, that has given itself permission to 'punch a Nazi’ where Nazis may be identified oh so loosely. <strong>They don’t raise this because they have no argument to it.</strong> They live it. If you are not interested in rational debate, you are interested only in power, as JP happens to charge, and <strong>woe to the society where such power goes past the point of no return, a very foreseeable future for JP and many others.</strong><br><br>Ironically, it is just such a tipping point <strong><i>to the right</i> </strong>that provides the foundation for extremist leftist beliefs, and therefore JP must be seen to actually be an advocate for this—-<strong>even though it is his profound fear of going too far right or left that is the basis of his own academic and now extra-academic career. </strong>Yet, that is no obstacle to the 'discussion’. <strong>Where your opponent does not give you ammunition, you invent it. </strong>Maclean’s more or less suggests that while JP does not specifically call for the rise of the Third Reich, he more or less does. He does not say in so many words that Teutonic racist gods ought to despotically rule over us, but if you listen closely in fact, he really does. <strong>Nowhere does he specifically call for re-enacting eugenics laws or to send women back to the kitchen where they belong, but if you were smart (and you are smart) you would see that he kind of actually literally does.</strong> <br><br>A staple of leftist conflation is then on full display: <strong>Anyone who sounds the alarm on the decline of Western civilization is actually just afraid of brown people and vaginas, are actually just sad low-IQ wannabe KKK members who ain’t looking forward to a life without His slaves (which Western civilization is based on, you see).</strong>  In these 'arguments’ which come up time and again, never is actual history brought up of course, about the cycle of civilizations, their rise and fall, of the very real and perhaps inevitable catastrophic devastation that occurs when the foundational order gives way, and that it is really not very difficult to see that occurring with a never before seen rapidity on today’s red hot political landscape.  Never is it brought up that <strong>cultures are not equal on any meaningful comparative scale</strong> and that the Enlightenment values on which our crumbling world is built is the only complex society that theoretically and actually served everyone remarkably well (yes, even minorities and women) when compared against any other system, and that what lies on the visible horizon, <strong>the unknown Coming New Order</strong> is far from certain, bodes of calamitous foreign and civil wars, and then into the dawning and erection of another world, one that will require our best moral and intellectual energies to avoid being swept into a less equitable world, a world for example without egalitarian Enlightenment values, like (duh!) free speech.<br><br> No mention of this silly idea, just baseless accusations that all of JP’s thoughtful concerns are merely a hateful front to pick on non-white males.  No, we just do not concern ourselves with what he is actually taking about. We simply declare:<br><br><blockquote>It’s easy to assume Peterson is deserving of respect. A lot of what he says sounds, on the surface, like serious thought. It’s easy to laugh at him: after all, most of what he says is, after fifteen seconds’ consideration, completely inane.</blockquote><br><br>Good god!<br><br>…I think back to my childhood, when Maclean’s and Chatelaine seemed so normal and innocuous and now I wonder if they were always so inane.  Yes, they probably were, though the world they commented on was more stable, more people were served by the orthodoxy. <strong>Then they undoubtedly were not sounding the alarm on creeping authoritarianism, because creeping authoritarianism had not yet metastasized</strong>—and taken over the Weltenshauung of mainstream Canadian women’s mags to the point that they now just thoughtlessly but willfully spout inarguable partisan bullshit.

    "content":"A political ad recently run in the Virginia gubernatorial campaign between (R) Ed Gillespie and (D) Ralph Northam has touched a few nerves. <strong>The ad depicts a Confederate flag flying pickup truck, complete with Don’t tread on me Gadsen plates and a Gillespie bumper sticker riding through the neighbourhood. Playing minority and disabled children spot the truck and run in fear. </strong>  The truck hunts them down in a dead end alley and just as they are about to be rounded up (and let’s face it the suggestion is that they will be executed), the children wake up from this nightmare. A voice-over is heard: 'Is this what Donald Trump and Ed Gillespie mean by the American Dream?’<br><br><div class='centered'><iframe width='560' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/SHZvVsGGY-U' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br><br>The ad paid for the Latino Victory fund was not authorized by the Ralph Northam, but naturally was also not condemned. Not surprisingly the ad was defended by dems and condemned as race-baiting by Republicans. It seems even the victory fund gave into the pressure and eventually pulled the ad, but not before the damage was done, which may have after all been an acceptable strategy by the group.<br><br>Northam won the election. Persuasion master Scott Adams is perhaps not amiss to suggest the ad is what tilted the race. <br><br><div class='centered'><blockquote class='twitter-tweet' data-lang='en'><p lang='en' dir='ltr'>Don’t forget the ad with the pickup truck.

Simple effectiveness. Furthermore, they certainly aren’t alone in exaggerating/pushing the envelope of decency/straight up lying with these visceral no holds barred ads. In that case, maybe the worst that can be said is that its in regrettably poor taste.  <strong>But maybe you would also have to say, that to be acquitted from this sin, that such propaganda is not leading to a poisoning of the public imagination, that such ads don’t stoke the fires of hatred enough to lead to the actual violence it hyperbolically depicts.</strong><br><br>Well that is an interesting question. Do people believe such an ad reflects reality? And do they believe this because the danger is real or because the false rhetoric convinced them, and now they are acting <i>as if its real</i>. Have they convinced themselves to the point that they are really living in fear, and really retaliating in kind with their own violence?<br><br><strong>This article will go on to elucidate that the imagery presented in the ad reflects a liberal paranoia borne of historical and economic ignorance.<br><br>This paranoia has blinded them, mischaracterizing what conservatives actually want. Liberals are also quite unaware of the origin of their own fears and how they are symptomatic of, and contributing to, making their own nightmare a reality.</strong><br><br>First of all let’s be clear. This isn’t happening. Ethnic cleansing does not exist in America in any sense of the word. Ok, sure the Dems might say, but it <i>could</i> and <strong>that is why we are out here now sounding the alarm! </strong>The evils of white nationalism you see in Richard Spencer could easily morph into active white supremacism—lynchings, roundups, race war. And Trump is the harbinger of this, if not the very living embodiment. <br><br>Of course the same skewing of reality vs potential exists largely in the image of Trump, </strong>a man who went from entertaining garish blowhard with a funny bird’s nest 'do to literally Hitler the moment he found himself atop the R ticket. It is no accident the ad explicitly linked Trump to Gillespie (even though Gillespie’s loss was often determined to have failed for not embracing Trump enough.)<br><br>Ok but lets be clear again. <strong>There is NOTHING to suggest Trump has anything in common in with Hitler or the KKK. No, 'grab her by the pussy’ does not make you Hitler. </strong>Yes, the talking point of the 'very fine people’ with tiki torches is alive and well in liberal la la land but the reasonable argument Trump was trying to make, as we shall see is that the unacceptable extremes of both sides were represented in Charlottesville but that these are not representative of the majority of people who were there. <strong>The fact of the matter is that Trump, as well as Bannon and the whole crew are not in any fair minded sense of the word white supremacists they have denounced time and again as clueless idiots who are not helping one bit. </strong>Patriotism and a simple viewpoint that America must have controlled immigration and border security are NOT equivalent to racial superiority, ethnic cleansing discourse. It is the norm past, present and future actually. Breitbart is NOT a white supremacist publication just because it happens to appeal to white males. None of this is happening, folks! <br><br>Ah <strong>but it could and that is why we are out here now sounding the alarm! </strong>Surely we are on the path to this more than we were say 20 years ago. <br><br>The answer to that negative racial progress is yes but history shows that the reason for that is simply rooted in economics. <strong>As economic security slacks so rises ethno-nationalism. Always, everywhere. It is also true that when economic insecurity reaches a literal breaking point, then fascism <i>does</i> turn hot and actual ethnic cleansing takes place. </strong>So it is reasonable to fear this.<br><br>Here is where the confusion begins. <strong>A liberal tends to identify the symptom as the cause. </strong>All is good until the racists show up and ruin the party. By speaking out/protesting/virtue-signally/enshrining HR policy they stem fascism and solve or at least mitigate the problem. Note this is also proof of the superiority of liberal ideas over conservative ones because if we all just helped and loved another everything will be fine.  The corollary is that conservatives are unintelligent (else they would do as we do you see) selfish and hate-filled and must be stamped out, literally if not ideologically.<br><br>Conservatives see the real cause—economics, which is also a big argument that liberal conflation stems from economic and historical illiteracy. Liberals do not see that their own solution—higher taxes, bigger government, affirmative action yada yada yada leads to worsening economic conditions, and that therefore liberal policy and attitudes are a contributing factor of the very problem they are trying to solve. <strong>They are like eat Cat in the Hat trying to clean up but just magnifying the problem.</strong><br><br>To wit, many liberals actually cannot see the difference between ethno-nationalism and libertarianism. A liberal just hates them as one and the same. Quite an astonishing feat of cognitive equivalency actually.<br><br>This needs some bearing out, if only for a liberal who happened to read this. It is true that ethno-nationalists are conservatives but not that all or even most conservatives are ethno-nationalists. Well, why aren’t there liberal ethno-nationalists they say? <strong>Surely there is something evil that lurks within the heart of the conservative which sullies and condemns the whole ideological stance.  Well yes there is something at the heart of conservatism that is evil—the recognition of the proclivities of man’s own heart. </strong>  Conservatism is based on the acceptance of the historical record of civilization, on a recognition of the fact that populations have always reflected the aggregate of basic self-interest.  When this self-interest is primal, when it has not built any co-operative culture or when it reverts to the shit hits the mad max fan you get barbarism.<strong> However conservative or liberal you might have been in halcyon days, it will be your family first, then your clan etc. The reality is that in scarcity you will kill outsiders if thats what it comes down to.  <br><br>Conservatives fear this world more than anything. You could call this fear foundational to their very souls.  </strong><br><br>As much as the liberal believes the conservative animal actually thirsts for the lawless world where they can scalp heads of another color, they do not. <strong>What conservatives want is to build a culture that wards this off forever, that is most prosperous and safe for the most individuals. The ideal political cultures to a conservative are also those born out by history, and which finally became enshrined into the America constitution; a spirit of limited government, right of free speech, right to bear arms (see limited govt), everyone equal before the law. You know the drill.</strong><br><br>It is when these traditions become corrupted that we are in trouble, and this is what most Trump conservatives are politically engaged about. They see a startling pattern from the entire Establishment, D’s and R’s alike. <strong> History shows that the state is the battleground of power and that over time, power networks crystallize into cronyism, the state becomes commandeered by elites to serve elites. </strong>Corruption. This is the main problem.  <br><br>Conservatives feel trapped by elite-driven corruption having taken their government hostage and stifled in the other side by living in a liberal reactionary atmosphere of a political correctness that has actually progressed to the point where free speech is railed against and their own speech is labelled hate speech increasingly punishable by jail. <strong>To a conservative it is corruption masquerading sometimes behind the popular appeal of SJW aims and and other times behind the lip service given to them by establishment R’s that has destroyed the economy, and that this has in turn re-awakened the ugliness in everyone, including the reprehensible fringe amongst their own ranks.  </strong><br><br>Conservatives see liberalism not as progression at all but as symptomatic of decadence, the mobilization of the deep seated ressentiment of the weak and disenfranchised, the (ironically) ignorant proles taking over, or worse, used as pawns as they alway have before, by ideological plutocrats who see no better future for humanity really than neo-feudalism/neo-communism, a where the average citizens live on a universal basic income, and is so taxed and regulated they have no hope of ever challenging the institutionalized power of double talking super-elite. <strong>In short, they see history repeating itself based on ignorance of what actually happened in the soviets.</strong><br><br>Why does the corruption of government not alarm the left? Or the erosion of the constitution, the anti-establishment right asks? <strong>Why do liberals not see the plan fact that antifa is equivalent to bolshevism, that they are the violent ones, that what the progressives are violently demanding not only ends in a worse disaster than the fascistic nightmare they so ignorantly but self-valiantly claim to be fighting against? </strong>Why does the left not know that German fascism rose to stomp out rampant violent leftism of the 1930’s and that therefore what could seem to bring about their own worst nightmare is their own increasingly reckless infringing behaviour? Moreover, why do they not see that if that comes about they will be outgunned badly?<br><br>Here is how the divisive class warfare-like play of resentment based socialist revolt has played out this time: The reality is no one is getting ahead except the 1%. Ignorant of the causes of economic insecurity, the failure of the masses to thrive, the backward trajectory of hope has needed a culprit.  Who has the power? The white man. This is then his fault. It must be since he has had and has the power. The majority of women, minorities (well except for Asians whose success destroys the entire liberal narrative) and beta white males who got no pussy blame white men. <strong>The white man rose solely on the backs of others, on theft, and if only they weren’t so racist, hateful, and misogynistic, we would all be rich. </strong> That is why this trope has manifest in popular culture, social and mass media but also in general socialist policy proliferation and programs of affirmative action, programs which have had no history of success, no economic rationale, and no basis in equality (this redistributive action is 'equity’ they say). <br><br><strong>Ironically, the world created by white males is the only culture that has ever existed that has bent over backwards to accommodate whoever was willing to put their hat in the ring, in part because western culture tries to improve the lot of the poor, thanks to universally inclusive values of the Enlightenment and Judeo-Christian values. </strong>And so this was has been stomached for a while. But now the economic situation has become intolerable and from a policy point of view, poor white men actually have the worst chance of success (there is no affirmative action for them) as well as still being blamed for the lack of success of all the other groups!  <br><br>White men are sick of the dismantling, the ingratitude, the ignorance.  As are economically and historically literate women and minorities. They know that government needs to roll back, that faith needs to be put into people’s opportunities, not in a fruitless bloody airing of eternal grievances. <strong>They want a return to the recognition that all we can do is give everyone an equal opportunity. </strong>We cannot ensure they all cross the finish line at the same time. It’s a mess, it will never be perfect. Yes, whites currently have the edge, because they have built their wealth and culture from the country’s origins. They have a head start you might say. Yes immigrants start at the bottom of the pile like they always have everywhere. <strong>The difference is the Ellis island folk knew that their engineering skills would be applied to janitorial services and that was that, but if they worked hard the opportunity would be there for their kids and grand kids, not that 6 figure jobs should be handed out to everyone like participation trophies. </strong>This goes hand in hand with the simple idea that the people we do let in are the right ones, not based on color but on the likelihood they are to succeed and integrate by adopting our successful culture, like the US always has.<br><br><strong>Voila populism, Trump and a swelling of ethno-nationalism. </strong><br><br>None of this is clear to liberals obviously and they can always choose to willfully ignore the facts and their own contributions to the dire trajectory of the nation. <strong>Vivid ads by the Latin victory party may win elections but they do not help the big picture. Any space within the popular imagination that perpetuates revenge in response to fables is anything but constructive. <strong>It is not a wonder so many more of these recent shooters have been driven by this ideology (rather than by the nazi phantom as is hoped by the liberal press). What is really not clear is if liberals will wake up to the damage the do to their own world enough before they become their own self fulfilling prophecy.  <strong>Since they seem to be oblivious of their own role and motivations, there isn’t much hope of this, and it may be that only a bettering of the economy, through technology, tax reform, animal spirits, a draining of the swamp—it doesn’t matter—any path of policy that reverses the trend of a widening gap between economic strata, and puts to bed the rising extremes on both sides. The outcome is by no means clear, and it is by no means assured that a new social paradigm that settles after the dust, when we all collectively wake up from this nightmare, will be a better one.</strong>"

    "content":"Baloney. That is how Hillary Rodham Clinton dismissed rumours of her treasonous corrupt behaviour, <strong>treating the affair as merely an insignificant 'he said / she said' back and forth you might see in a cheesy 70’s sitcom. All that was missing was the laugh track. I mean really, who says 'Baloney’ except your dear irretrievably uncool time-warp caught aunt? </strong><br><br>’Rumours’ of corruption of course is an understatement. <br><br>The Hill reported that the FBI was aware of Russian bribery and extortion tactics in acquiring 20 percent of America’s uranium supply through the Canadian firm Uranium One. The deal was signed while Hillary was Secretary of State. <strong>The high-ranking whistleblower was shocked it went through. </strong>The $145 million donation to the Clinton Foundation by the same Russian extorters must have just been a mere co-incidence, the $500,000 speaking fee collected by Bill Clinton after meeting with Vladimir Putin totally unrelated, the fact that the Obama administration turned a blind eye to his successor's shenangans? Nothin’ to do with it. <br><br><strong>“I would say it’s the same baloney they’ve been peddling for years, and there’s been no credible evidence by anyone. In fact, it’s been debunked repeatedly and will continue to be debunked.”  </strong><br><br>This is the game of sound bite politics. All you do you is lump your transgressions in with the regular meaningless party mudslinging.  You know, that stuff you are bored of? <strong>To reinforce, you go on to invoke the Pavlovian buzzword 'debunked’. 'Repeatedly debunked’ is even better. Kudos to HRC. </strong>No silly, whether any credible debunking has ever taken place is not of much consequence. <br><br>Now, as a Clinton despiser, my typical reaction to such utterances from the Hildebeest is that she is a corrupt, deceitful psychopath. When I’m feeling more generous, like the Big D, I call her a 'survivor', a shrewd Nixon-esque master player able to keep her enemies at bay while achieving her own aims. And heck, she is doing much more than surviving: <strong>she’s become fabulously wealthy on a government salary, worshipped by millions of women. </strong>Even after the Trumping, I don’t believe she has given up on becoming President. That is ballsy. Gotta say. <br><br><strong>And when I am in a positively Christian mood, I charitably think she is completely oblivious to how her conduct appears, that she really believes what she says, that she is, as she would love us all to have, is simply an innocent champion of the People. </strong><br><br>So what is it with this woman? Psycho, master politician, innocent champion? These are all viable options explaining her conduct. Likely of course—and here I’ll spoil my conclusion—<strong>she’s probably a terrifying combination of them all.  </strong><br><br>Nevetheless, let’s run it down a bit.<br><br>Psychos are no stranger to politics. They are practically born for it. <strong>Narcissism, brazenly amoral actions, and the ability to crush underfoot anyone without a twinge of empathy can get you far, as the high ratio of this scourge-like ilk in the lavish citadels of politics, media and C-suite boardrooms attest.</strong>  Looking at the history of the Clintons with anything but the most partisan eyes of a Demming, it's like, 'Wow!’, really easy to imagine the Clintons as a pair of master psychos who have, quite amazingly, not only not managed to not get locked up forever with Eddie from Iron Maiden, but are the most successful political couple in the history of the United States <strong>(House of Cards brought this to the popular imagination. It’s a wonder Hillary did not blame Robin Wright for her loss).</strong> I mean c’mon, that Clinton body count is <i>HIGH</i>, way higher than the law of co-incidences permits a sane person to accept without some serious reservations.<br> <br><nr>Considering the endless scandals and trail of self-serving destruction behind these two, I sometimes ask myself: 'Is it possible to live the lives the Clinton’s have lived without being psychos?’ and I've yet to get back a definitive answer. For our purposes the more pertinent question however is 'Do we want a psycho running anything at all.' And although a serious topic for a later date is 'How psychos make the world go round', conventional thinking gives an emphatic 'No'.<br><br>Possibility two. Hillary as Nixon. And when I invoke Nixon, the parallel with Watergate is completely co-incidental. Even accounting for wg, Nixon is a veritable angel in comparison. The comparison is directly to how Nixon rose to power, against all odds, through shrewd maneuvering, questionable tactics and helped mostly by himself.<br><br>What if I, a 400-pound blogger with Dorito crumbs on my chest, simply don’t know the world of politics enough? That is, perhaps in the Beltway, doing whatever is necessary to thrive is simply common behaviour, and the Clintons, like Nixon, should actually be lauded for begin so good at it. Or maybe she is not exactly normal, but just a little more extreme that the others; Hillary as outlier, which again can be taken as an argument in her favor. <strong>Nice guys finish last; ruthlessness and tact are the qualities par excellence, so we must root for the scumbag who is actually going to succeed and then throw us some scraps. Machiavellianism is not a historical doctrine, but a timeless one. </strong><br><br>To take it a step further, maybe there is no real morality; its all just a power struggle, so on what she does, she cannot be judged. The only measure of quality is success. In such a world, the real role of morality is to act as a fiction, a cover, perhaps useful for raising children with platitudes, a temporary shield from ugliness as we hide from them gore, violence and porn. <strong>Maybe it is even more useful for the majority of adults to believe in the fiction as well. Morality as a de facto <i>strategic result</i> of the ruthless ruling class, whose members are not so much hereditary as they are places taken by force one by one, time and again, by the 'strong' among us. </strong>A corollary of this, like the trope seen in so many gangster films, this class of under-world-movers brings their innocent families with them, providing for them, as an ancient bloodthirsty king might keep a harem and a garden of innocence for his Siddharthas. Morality as charade perpetuated by the strong who know that goodness is only possible when taken with a pound of flesh, and then given to the innocent defenseless loved ones. HRC and Nixon, like anyone, wanted success for themselves and, having neither wealth nor connections, fought tooth and nail to become who they were, alpha champions in a sliding scale of relative and ultimately arbitrary values.<br><br><strong>It is this sliding scale, so often given by post-modernists, a lynchpin of leftist doctrine, that morality has no compass, that it is just the result of material power made ideological, reflecting power relations, that qualifies and vindicates HRC. </strong><br><br>Morality is indeed manifest thus, but it does not change the fact that we do in fact have values upon which Western civilization is based, and therefore we can critique its gross transgressions, espcially if we determine that a corruption of these values leads to a degradation and a path to destruction. If we hold thus, no matter how much of a warrior she might be, we cannot accept a world where anything goes, where there are no limits to what one may do to achieve power. History is the guide. <strong>Empires are built on dreams, on sacred values, morals, and ethics that allowed it to thrive. They die on corruption of those values, when those values become only a sanctimonious robe to be donned whenever necessary, to be fluent in rather than a model of, to be used as a conduit for raw power, rather than as foundation for a social prosperity with much wider benefits to the whole.</strong> A lynchpin of our values is that no one is above the law, and while that has never been fulfilled to the letter on a large scale, it is still vital to the greatest civiliiation the world has ever known that we constatnly strive to maintain this as much as possible; and its corruption must be fought every step of the way.<strong> We cannot look idly on as this corruption becomes the modus operandi of elites. </strong>While empires have always succumbed, that is no reason to meekly accept decadence, an ever brazen grand scale of graft, a mockery of the offices of the state, and well, <i>all that is sacred to us</i>. Just as the Uranium One deal is the most corrupt in the history of the United States, Hillary, by virtue of her status and deeds, is rightly judged among the worst of the worst.<br><br><strong>Possibility three: Maybe Hillary Clinton really does believe what she says. That she is innocent of corruption here. She can in fact invoke baloney in good faith. </strong>That in her 'Russia reset’ policy mindset, this was a good deal for the US and for US-Russia relations, that if the Russians wanted to be fools and give her $145 million, she sure as hell wasn’t going to say no, since this money will eventually go to AIDS stricken children the world over. Even better, she really had no idea that this was even happening at her foundation. Secretary of State is a busy job.<br><br>Is this innocence credible? Believe it or not there really are arguable reasons for this to be the case. After all, its not like she has to convince most people, ordinary and powerful alike. She did win the popular vote. There are no shortage of talking heads and elite journalists supporting her ever move. The liberal media knows what’s good for them, as do all the other facets of Corporate America. <strong>Indeed the whole question of innocence extends to all comfortably ensconced in the corrupt Establishment of this late stage capitalist empire.</strong><br><br> Here's the funny thing about large powerful capitalist organizations: they are focused on a bottom-line goal; if you won’t do the dirty wok, someone else will, and who will do it better than someone who will actually believe it? Therefore, the more powerful the role, the more likely one is to believe in the what they say and do, to be blind to or at least unfazed of its obvious underlying motive, whether its big party politics, or an Exxon, Nestle, Monsanto exec believing the public relations pablum produced by the firm.<br><br><strong> Morality of the corporate agent is shaped by the goals of the corporate org, which goes a long way to saying that the morality of capitalist states is derivative of profit-seeking, and that since this is an unsightly thought, that a lot of effort goes into denying this unseemly underpinning, that cognitive dissonance is a welcome product of such a society. </strong><br><br>As inceredible as it might be to a critic, HRC might well believe herself, as do the folks at CNN, Facebook and the CIA, who back her with their equally innocent totalitarian actions, who would have been more than happy to righteously have her lead the way instead of this troublesome unpredictable oranged-headed fop. (Why no, I didn’t realize I was describing the Deep State, but yes, you're quite right perhaps!)<br><br>The critique of this is similar to point two. <strong>We may accept that we don't live in a perfect world, and that to live with the fundamentally incompatible corrupting influcence of captialism is still a Panglossian best of all possible worlds--on the whole, but its negative tendencies must be mitigated at all possible turns. </strong>We must remain aware that power corrupts and that it will also produce as alibi a legitimizing but deceitful discourse, and we must not allow that discourse to provide cover for criminal behaviour. That is, even if Clinton was somehow unaware of the $145 donation to here foundation, she is still negligent (as in the case of the emails, and the DNC rigging etc) and responsible. She should be held accountable and really, go to prison, should it be found to be true.<br><br>In conclusion, certainly there is enough of this rationalization and benefit-of-the-doubting to encourage a team of insufferably bright lawyers to come to the defense of HRC and even more the Deep State to continue to convince the majority of Hillary's insistent virtue. <br><br>But you see, that is problem itself. Just as a politician can answer a simple yes or no question with a 20 minute lecture that never addresses the question, if one is defending oneself one never needs to admit to anything. One simply builds supportive narrative while ignoring the damning ones. That is the plain purpose and deconstruction of Hillary's baloney. Who has time to discern? Who wants to? Not the Demmings and not the Deep State who needs are satisfied with HRC en toto.<br><br> But if as Washington said 'The price of truth is eternal vigilance' we simply cannot let official lies pass as truth. <strong><br><br> Whether psycho, Nixon-esque or 'innocent champion' the case against HRC is simple. She is corrupt.  As for me, I'm all growed up. I don’t eat baloney no more and admittedly the chant in the distance is music to my ears. 'Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!'</strong>,"

  "content":"Just go and look at any social media feed about Martin Shkreli (MS) and you will see that he is aptly named ’the most hated man in America’. <strong>Endless streams of blind hate. Graphic and disturbing actually.</strong> <br><br>Throughout these interminable screeching threads, MS has been referred to as symbolic of <strong>'everything wrong with America’</strong>—-the immoral excesses of capitalism, wonton disregard for human life, contempt for all things decent etc. etc. Just to make a slimy buck. It does not get worse than jacking up the price of a life saving drug 5000%, so let him rot in prison for all eternity! Worse, let him suffer all the unspeakable things FB commenters have wished on him. This goes well beyond MS of course. <strong>It just wouldn’t be a comment board in 2017 if the overt equation of evil personified were not made with Donald Trump and by extension all Trump supporters, who as every good person knows, are just waiting for the code word to don their KKK emblazoned brown shirts and reenact the Beer Hall Putsch until the dust settles again with only two genders and one colour.</strong> This, you see, is ’everything that is wrong with America.’ You know the story, and perhaps you agree with it. As promised, however, I will make the case that it is the VERY opposite; It is how MS has been treated that is symbolic of everything that is wrong in America.<br><br>MS’s problems started when Hillary Clinton publicly accused him in a FB post of drug price gouging, compassionately imploring (as only a Dem leader can) to “do the right thing” and bring the price back to previous levels. On the other hand you could say that his problems also ended there because that prima facie accusation is where the court of public opinion stopped on the matter.<br><br><strong>In this world of endless tidbits of radically different texts and information, people need to read something, make an immediate judgement and move on.</strong> Next comment, next post, next story. The motive is to process it, to fit it in their worldview and move on. Without judgement we admit ignorance, and that will not do.  <strong>It therefore helps to have an infantile but easily digestible prism of good vs evil, something like sharers vs the greedy, or yes! Socialists vs capitalists. </strong>Socialism/sharing is intuitive. Capitalism, that self interest results in the greatest social benefit, is not. Events become literal memes in this world of moments—-and, this point is essential, not for what they are, but for what we can get out of them. What it says about it us, how we can leverage it to our advantage. It is this intellectual laziness, borne of egotism and ignorance, exhibited as virtue signalling, that is the root of the problem. <br><br>There are consequences to this ironically selfish laziness: Society, our culture, is ever more a reflection of the aggregate of these millions of mimetic interpretations and responses.  <strong>Yet, this does not change the fact that it is our responsibility as members of the polis to think through the consequences of our judgements, and that this cannot be done without prudent analysis.</strong> Oh we learn from our mistakes when it concerns us. We see the effects of our decisions first hand and make adjustments, but on judgements concerning others far removed, on flippant reactions and resentiments/resentments, the consequences can be ignored until its far too late to correct (until the boot is stamping endlessly on your face as Bezemov says), because there is nothing incontrovertibly clear that ties those consequences to our judgements.  <br><br>	 Back to MS. <strong>This is how it went down, existentially. “What?! MS hiked drug prices 5000%! Therefore poor people (AIDS patients no less, so I’m sniffing some easy homophobic grist here!) will die just so he can be rich! Finished! Judgment laid done. Reprisal factor almost nil. You know because sometimes the issue is not so clear so I don’t feel comfortable weighing in, but this one is easy! Let me let loose a torrent of my built up hate for these evil, selfish, stupid people (conservatives, Republicans, white males. etc) that are ruining everything! (And do not underestimate the value—and political and personal utility—of the Orwellian '2 minute hate’ to the frustrated, confused individual) </strong>If only everyone was like me, like the good, intelligent decent ones, the world would have no problems and I could enjoy my friggin’ Starbucks and Big Bang Theory (I like it because it’s intelligent). O how I miss Obama <strong>(I love black people. They so funky)!</strong><br><br>Ok, that is the individual level, but the permeation of institutions with this metastasizing sickness unto death ethos is unmistakable and frankly alarming.  <strong>Politicians like HRC use it to fire their base, the media to sell. Circuit judges, government officials and schoolteachers/professors use it to become activists for their myopic good.  Social media giants in conjunction with the NSA use it to implement censorship. This is bad. I think everyone knows this. </strong>Or do they?<br><br>Ok, but wait, wait, wait…What did MS actually do? Because after all a person who did what he alleged is actually deplorable and deserving of derision, no? So what were the consequences of the drug hike? Did people die or suffer? Well no, actually. MS offered and did give the drug for $1 to anyone who was not uninsured.  MS did gouge the government through the insurance companies, but guess what? <strong>That is what ObamaCare, written by insurance companies, is effectively designed to do.</strong> (Democrats would not support single payer because of lobbying efforts so this was the compromise—enrich the insurance companies who could now charge whatever they wanted for covered drugs in exchange for insuring the uninsured. This is ultimately paid for by higher premiums on middle & middle-upper class workers, and btw Trump supporters know this so they voted to repeal it, because they pay 113% more premiums for worse service. Turns out you could not 'keep your doctor’ after all)) <br><br>So MS’s plan was to use that extra money to improve the drug, the company, etc. (And yes to pay the company employees and himself. There is no doubt people want to be rich.)  Until MS bought the drug there were no such plans. That is what happens to drugs, which are products. They reach their market potential and then stagnate into a neglected niche until someone comes along who sees an opportunity to profit from improving or replacing it. <strong>Discovering and pursuing these opportunities is what drug companies do, and that is also by far the most efficient way of creating new life improving drugs (and this benefit of the American system is often overlooked. Much as a place like Canada benefits from the US security blanket, we also benefit from its capitalist induced innovation in the field of medicine), just as capitalism, the pursuit of self-interest, is far and away the most efficient way of improving standards of living for society as a whole.</strong> <br><br>B<strong>ut this 'complex’ narrative serves no one, not Hillary Clinton, nor Democrats, nor virtual signalling, hate-filled, reactionary social media zombies in search of likes, friend counts and blow jobs.</strong> It is too subtle to be processed by the convenient mimetic filters low information people operate on. It is also risky because others must also be able to process you.<br><br><strong>The reaction to HRC’s post led to a (MSM and social) media-induced witch hunt and so MS’s business was targeted and this is what his recent conviction of 'defrauding investors’ was about. MS faces up to 20 years in jail.</strong>  It is widely believed (if there is any sanity to the court) he will serve much less.  Why? Oh because in his 'ponzi scheme’ investors lost exactly $0 and in fact many made many millions! Yes, he did break the rules about how he shuffled money around. That is an important regulatory issue but last time I checked 'fraud’ only sends people to jail when people are defrauded, you know, lose shitloads of money due to criminal motives? (Of course, MS lost $40 million since he was dragged into this, but who cares right?) So then some federal NY liberal judge who felt MS did not deserve bail granted to him, overturned this decision (quite reminiscent of how circuit judges in Hawaii think they can overrule the President on national immigration rulings, you say?) for jokingly calling for a strand of HRC’s hair (he wanted to analyze her DNA sequence), and now he is being sent to Brooklyn Metropolitan Correctional Center to serve time with terrorists and big time gangsters like El Chapo. El Chapo!! <strong>That is price of trolling these days. Especially if you are a Trump Supporter, which MS very vocally is (only right wingers are trolls didn’t you know?).</strong>  <br><br>The sad thing is this, and in a way, I guess this is my main point and motive for writing this: I followed MS’s story and even interacted with him on Twitter.<strong> This guy is brilliant, hilarious, innovative, irreverent. This is the type of guy only America at its best can produce and yet more and more America seems a place where exceptionalism is crushed under the burgeoning weight of stifling, stalinesque conformism from, well, increasingly everywhere: school teachers, professors, social media, HR depts, government, judiciary, you name it—and that is why I say that MS is not the symbol of everything bad in the US, but exactly its opposite, his treatment is symbolic of everything bad in the US.</strong><br><br><a href='https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/05/obamacare-fowler-lobbyist-industry1'>Liz Fowler - author of ACA</a><br><br>"

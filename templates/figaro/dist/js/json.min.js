Graphic and disturbing actually.</strong> <br><br>Throughout these interminable screeching threads, MS has been referred to as symbolic of <strong>‘everything wrong with America’</strong>—-the immoral excesses of capitalism, wonton disregard for human life, contempt for all things decent etc. etc. Just to make a slimy buck. It does not get worse than jacking up the price of a life saving drug 5000%, so let him rot in prison for all eternity! Worse, let him suffer all the unspeakable things FB commenters have wished on him. This goes well beyond MS of course. <strong>It just wouldn’t be a comment board in 2017 if the overt equation of evil personified were not made with Donald Trump and by extension all Trump supporters, who as every good person knows, are just waiting for the code word to don their KKK emblazoned brown shirts and reenact the Beer Hall Putsch until the dust settles again with only two genders and one colour.</strong> This, you see, is ’everything that is wrong with America.’ You know the story, and perhaps you agree with it. As promised, however, I will make the case that it is the VERY opposite; It is how MS has been treated that is symbolic of everything that is wrong in America.<br><br>MS’s problems started when Hillary Clinton publicly accused him in a FB post of drug price gouging, compassionately imploring (as only a Dem leader can) to “do the right thing” and bring the price back to previous levels. On the other hand you could say that his problems also ended there because that prima facie accusation is where the court of public opinion stopped on the matter.<br><br><strong>In this world of endless tidbits of radically different texts and information, people need to read something, make an immediate judgement and move on.</strong> Next comment, next post, next story. The motive is to process it, to fit it in their worldview and move on. Without judgement we admit ignorance, and that will not do.  <strong>It therefore helps to have an infantile but easily digestible prism of good vs evil, something like sharers vs the greedy, or yes! Socialists vs capitalists. </strong>Socialism/sharing is intuitive. Capitalism, that self interest results in the greatest social benefit, is not. Events become literal memes in this world of moments—-and, this point is essential, not for what they are, but for what we can get out of them. What it says about it us, how we can leverage it to our advantage. It is this intellectual laziness, borne of egotism and ignorance, exhibited as virtue signalling, that is the root of the problem. <br><br>There are consequences to this ironically selfish laziness: Society, our culture, is ever more a reflection of the aggregate of these millions of mimetic interpretations and responses.  <strong>Yet, this does not change the fact that it is our responsibility as members of the polis to think through the consequences of our judgements, and that this cannot be done without prudent analysis.</strong> Oh we learn from our mistakes when it concerns us. We see the effects of our decisions first hand and make adjustments, but on judgements concerning others far removed, on flippant reactions and resentiments/resentments, the consequences can be ignored until its far too late to correct (until the boot is stamping endlessly on your face as Bezemov says), because there is nothing incontrovertibly clear that ties those consequences to our judgements.  <br><br>	 Back to MS. <strong>This is how it went down, existentially. “What?! MS hiked drug prices 5000%! Therefore poor people (AIDS patients no less, so I’m sniffing some easy homophobic grist here!) will die just so he can be rich! Finished! Judgment laid done. Reprisal factor almost nil. You know because sometimes the issue is not so clear so I don’t feel comfortable weighing in, but this one is easy! Let me let loose a torrent of my built up hate for these evil, selfish, stupid people (conservatives, Republicans, white males. etc) that are ruining everything! (And do not underestimate the value—and political and personal utility—of the Orwellian ‘2 minute hate’ to the frustrated, confused individual) </strong>If only everyone was like me, like the good, intelligent decent ones, the world would have no problems and I could enjoy my friggin’ Starbucks and Big Bang Theory (I like it because it’s intelligent). O how I miss Obama <strong>(I love black people. They so funky)!</strong><br><br>Ok, that is the individual level, but the permeation of institutions with this metastasizing sickness unto death ethos is unmistakable and frankly alarming.  <strong>Politicians like HRC use it to fire their base, the media to sell. Circuit judges, government officials and schoolteachers/professors use it to become activists for their myopic good.  Social media giants in conjunction with the NSA use it to implement censorship. This is bad. I think everyone knows this. </strong>Or do they?<br><br>Ok, but wait, wait, wait…What did MS actually do? Because after all a person who did what he alleged is actually deplorable and deserving of derision, no? So what were the consequences of the drug hike? Did people die or suffer? Well no, actually. MS offered and did give the drug for $1 to anyone who was not uninsured.  MS did gouge the government through the insurance companies, but guess what? That is what ObamaCare, written by insurance companies, is effectively designed to do. (Democrats would not support single payer because of lobbying efforts so this was the compromise—enrich the insurance companies who could now charge whatever they wanted for covered drugs in exchange for insuring the uninsured. This is ultimately paid for by higher premiums on middle & middle-upper class workers, and btw Trump supporters know this so they voted to repeal it, because they pay 113% more premiums for worse service. Turns out you could not ‘keep your doctor’ after all)) <br><br>So MS’s plan was to use that extra money to improve the drug, the company, etc. (And yes to pay the company employees and himself. There is no doubt people want to be rich.)  Until MS bought the drug there were no such plans. That is what happens to drugs, which are products. They reach their market potential and then stagnate into a neglected niche until someone comes along who sees an opportunity to profit from improving or replacing it. <strong>Discovering and pursuing these opportunities is what drug companies do, and that is also by far the most efficient way of creating new life improving drugs (and this benefit of the American system is often overlooked. Much as a place like Canada benefits from the US security blanket, we also benefit from its capitalist induced innovation in the field of medicine), just as capitalism, the pursuit of self-interest, is far and away the most efficient way of improving standards of living for society as a whole.</strong> <br><br>But this ‘complex’ narrative serves no one, not Hillary Clinton, nor Democrats, nor virtual signalling, hate-filled, reactionary social media zombies in search of likes, friend counts and blow jobs. It is too subtle to be processed by the convenient mimetic filters low information people operate on. It is also risky because others must also be able to process you.<br><br>The reaction to HRC’s post led to a (MSM and social) media-induced witch hunt and so MS’s business was targeted and this is what his recent conviction of ‘defrauding investors’ was about. MS faces up to 20 years in jail.  It is widely believed (if there is any sanity to the court) he will serve much less.  Why? Oh because in his ‘ponzi scheme’ investors lost exactly $0 and in fact many made many millions! Yes, he did break the rules about how he shuffled money around. That is an important regulatory issue but last time I checked ‘fraud’ only sends people to jail when people are defrauded, you know, lose shitloads of money due to criminal motives? (Of course, MS lost $40 million since he was dragged into this, but who cares right?) So then some federal NY liberal judge who felt MS did not deserve bail granted to him, overturned this decision (quite reminiscent of how circuit judges in Hawaii think they can overrule the President on national immigration rulings, you say?) for jokingly calling for a strand of HRC’s hair (he wanted to analyze her DNA sequence), and now he is being sent to Brooklyn Metropolitan Correctional Center to serve time with terrorists and big time gangsters like El Chapo. El Chapo!! <strong>That is price of trolling these days. Especially if you are a Trump Supporter, which MS very vocally is (only right wingers are trolls didn’t you know?).</strong>  <br><br>The sad thing is this, and in a way, I guess this is my main point and motive for writing this: I followed MS’s story and even interacted with him on Twitter.<strong> This guy is brilliant, hilarious, innovative, irreverent. This is the type of guy only America at its best can produce and yet more and more America seems a place where exceptionalism is crushed under the burgeoning weight of stifling, stalinesque conformism from, well, increasingly everywhere: school teachers, professors, social media, HR depts, government, judiciary, you name it—and that is why I say that MS is not the symbol of everything bad in the US, but exactly its opposite, his treatment is symbolic of everything bad in the US.</strong><br><br><a href='https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/05/obamacare-fowler-lobbyist-industry1'>Liz Fowler - author of ACA</a><br><br>"}];

              Antonio Conte has been speaking
            </div>
            <div class="content">
              Antonio Conte has been speaking about the qualities of new signing Danny Drinkwater, as well as the midfielder’s relationship with N’Golo Kante, ahead of today’s visit to their former club Leicester City. Drinkwater was one of two deadline-day arrivals at Stamford Bridge along with Italian defender Davide Zappacosta, who signed from Torino, and could potentially make his Chelsea debut this afternoon.During the 2015/16 campaign Drinkwater formed a formidable midfield partnership withKante as Leicester defied the odds to win the Premier League title, and Conte believes they will work well together once again.‘I think Danny is a really good player,’ said Conte. ‘Two years ago together with N’Golo they won the league. They played regularly and showed how strong they were.‘Danny is a strong player who can help us. The midfield is very important. I need midfielders with particular characteristics which he has. Now he must find his best physical condition to be ready tohelp us.’Conte also explained why the fact we have signed two new players will not lead to a change in shape or system for his side.‘We want to continue to play with this system because, don’t forget, there are 11 players who played last season and we changed our system to give them the best condition to exploit their talent. With the new signings we have to try to give them the best chance to be in top condition.’

              In their Man United game, Jose Mourinho had special measures to deal with Leicester’s biggest threat: wingers Demarai Gray and Marc Albrighton, forwards Jamie Vardy, and now Kelechi Iheanacho, finding space behind the defence from raking passes by the
              likes of Riyad Mahrez. Vardy, with Shinji Okazaki just behind, gave the Gunners’ rearguard a tough ride at times on the opening day but the Red Devils defended deep and blocked channels in midfield, forcing him into wide areas. Chelsea may
              try to win the battle for midfield and stifle the hosts’ danger men in similar fashion.

He has also been in action for Germany over the international break, with notable success too, so the official Chelsea website sat down with the summer addition to the defence to look back at the opening weeks and ahead to games to come, including this afternoon’s fixture in Leicester.

              Our youth team return to action in the Under-18 Premier League this morning (Saturday), with Arsenal the visitors to Cobham for a London derby captured live by the Chelsea TV cameras (kick-off 10.30am).The young Blues will tick over 900 days unbeaten at home in all competitions if they avoid defeat against the Gunners, who were the nearest challengers to Jody Morris’s side last term, finishing runners-up to our youngsters in the both the south section and national merit round.It is an unblemished record that stretches across four different seasons, 42 games undefeated all the way back to April 2015 when Middlesbrough took the points home following a 3-1 victory.

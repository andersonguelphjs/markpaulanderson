Thanks to your generosity in giving more than $1 million for research into its causes, we can now do more to give the young people it affects the hope they need and the help they deserve.”<br><br><strong>Trevor Young</strong>, Dean of Medicine, University of Toronto explained that as U of T is one of the world’s top research universities and the only faculty of medicine in the Greater Toronto Area, it is uniquely positioned to effect change in mental health. “Our researchers are improving understanding of the physiology of mental illness and finding new insights into how it can be treated. U of T is also integrating psychiatry with other areas of medicine, across its network of nine affiliatedhospitals and 25 community sites, including the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) and Sick Kids.” <br><br>In the spirit of fostering awareness and understanding, this year’s dinner featured inspiring speakers <strong>Sophie Grégoire Trudeau</strong> and Barenaked Ladies founder <strong>Steven Page</strong>, who talked candidly and courageously of their personal battles with mental illness, and <strong>Jamie and Patsy Anderson</strong>, recipients of the 2017 Miner’s Lamp Award for their lifelong dedication to mental health. The Andersons received their award from inaugural Miner’s Lamp Award winner, <strong>Paul Beeston</strong>, former President & CEO, TorontoBlue Jays & Rogers Centre.<br><br>In accepting the award, Patsy Anderson said: “We are so proud to be part of a community that has chosen to learn about mental health and which advocates for those who are challenged by mental health issues.” Jamie Anderson added: “I like to remind people that our mind is far and away the most complicated part of us. Relative to other health issues, it has been under-resourced and under-researched.”<br><br>Other inspiring mental health advocates <strong>George Cope</strong>, President & CEO, BCE (and founder of “Bell Let’s Talk”) and <strong>Michael Landsberg</strong> (host of “Landsberg in the Morning” and founder of SickNotWeak) also attended the dinner. <br><br>Reflecting on the evening, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau summed up the renewed sense of hope generated by the academic and business and communities’ partnership: “It's my sincere wish that every person who struggles with mental health can find support, love and acceptance. It warmed my heart to see so many people come together to support the Miner’s Lamp Innovation Fund in Prevention & Early Detection of Severe Mental Illness. Thank you for taking mental illness seriously, and for dedicating theresources needed to build better and more effective treatments.”<br><br><strong><i>One hundred percent of event proceeds have been invested in the Miner's Lamp Innovation Fund in the Prevention and Early Detection of Severe Mental Illness.</i></strong>"},{id:3,imgSrc:"dist/assets/images/six/aImage3",title:"The 2017 Miner's Lamp Award - what's in a name?",isMLArticle:!0,date:"May 1, 2016",author:"",content:"Fundamental to IAMGOLD’s work as a global mining company is its core purpose: <i>to enrich the lives of its stakeholders.</i>  In this spirit, IAMGOLD has built a partnership with the University of Toronto Department of Psychiatry to create the Miner’s Lamp Award.The Miner’s Lamp Award symbolizes the innovative work being done to shed light on mental illness and erode the stigma attached to it.  <br><br>In the early days of industrial mining, many miners died when their lighting devices ignited invisible, unstable gases. These fatalities were devastating for communities whose continued prosperity depended on sending their young men to extract minerals from the earth and seeing them return safely.  <br><br>  Over time, thanks to the courageous determination of many to improve perilous working conditions and protect the most vulnerable, safety lamps were introduced. Their flames changed colour when deadly gases were detected, helping save countless lives. <br><br> Thankfully, today, we are spared the everyday challenges our mining ancestors faced. But with one in five Canadians likely to suffer mental illness at some point in their lifetime, we must remain vigilant about a disease that will touch us all, directly or indirectly, and affect the quality of our lives. <br><br>We created the Miner’s Lamp Award to honour the achievements of today’s leaders in the field of mental health who are lighting the way forward for all of us - and encourage others to follow their lead.

We created the Miner’s Lamp Award to honour the achievements of today’s leaders in the field of mental health who are lighting the way forward for all of us - and encourage others to follow their lead. <br><br> We are proud to announce that the 2018 Miner’s Lamp Award winner is <strong>George Cope</strong>, President & CEO, BCE Inc. and Bell Canada. <br><br>Mr. Cope is well known in the business world for his leadership in transforming Canada’s largest communications company into the nation’s broadband leader. Over the past 30 years, he has earned a reputation as a strategic leader and builder of high-performance teams.  <br><br>On March 27, 2018, we are delighted to honour Mr. Cope for his extraordinary leadership and innovation in leading the launch of Bell Let’s Talk.  <br><br>In a country where one in five Canadians will personally experience mental illness in their lifetime, Bell Let’s Talk has helped to shift public attitudes towards mental health, fostering a spirit of increased understanding and acceptance, while generating much-needed funds for projects targeting mental health across the country.  <br><br>Bell Let’s Talk is the largest-ever corporate commitment to Canadian mental health and now one of the country’s most prominent community investment campaigns. <br><br>For generations past, the shame of suffering mental illness prevented many people from seeking the help they needed to get better. Combined with a general lack of insight into the causes of mental illness, their reluctant silence reinforced the stifling stigma surrounding the disease. One of the crowning achievements of Bell Let’s Talk has been to help break the silence and move the conversation about mental health from the shadows into the light. <br><br>We invite you to join us at the 2018 Miner’s Lamp Award Dinner to celebrate the inspiring leadership of George Cope.
